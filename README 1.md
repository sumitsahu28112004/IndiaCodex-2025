NFT Minter

Project Description

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Cardano blockchain. It allows users to mint a custom, unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) directly to their wallet. The application features a dynamic user interface where users can define the NFT's name, description, and image, providing a personalized minting experience.
